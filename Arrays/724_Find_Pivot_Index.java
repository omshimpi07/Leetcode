724. Find Pivot Index
Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.
The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.
Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

Example 1: Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6] Output: 3 Explanation: The pivot index is 3. Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11 Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11 Example 2: Input: nums = [1,2,3] Output: -1 Explanation: There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement. Example 3: Input: nums = [2,1,-1] Output: 0 Explanation: The pivot index is 0. Left sum = 0 (no elements to the left of index 0) Right sum = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + -1 = 0
Difficulty : easy   

Approach:
1. Calculate the total sum of the input array.  
2. Initialize two variables, leftsum and rightsum, to keep track of the sum of elements to the left and right of the current index, respectively.
3. Iterate through the input array, and for each index: 
    - Update the right sum by subtracting the current element and the left sum from the total sum (rightsum = total - leftsum - nums[i]).
    - Check if the left sum is equal to the right sum. If they are equal, return the current index as the pivot index.
    - Update the left sum by adding the current element to it (leftsum += nums[i]). 
4. If no pivot index is found after iterating through the array, return -1.
Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array, since we are
iterating through the array twice (once to calculate the total sum and once to find the pivot index).
Space Complexity: O(1) since we are using only a constant amount of extra space to

            rightsum = total - leftsum - nums[i];
            if(leftsum == rightsum ){
                return i;
            }
            leftsum +=nums[i];
        }
        return -1;
